**Priority**: High

### Immediate Goals

1. ✅ Build main canvas component with SVG rendering
2. ✅ Implement pan/zoom controls and 8px background grid
3. ✅ Add keyboard navigation and event sourcing integration
4. ✅ Create responsive and performant canvas interface
5. ✅ Implement Document and Agent Node Components with drag functionality
6. ✅ Build Edge Connection System with bezier curves and automatic connections
7. ✅ Create Left Sidebar Object Library with 320px fixed width

## Recent Decisions & Considerations

### Architecture Decisions

- **TDD Workflow**: Test-first development with specialized sub-agents ✅ WORKING
- **Schema-Driven**: Zod schemas as single source of truth ✅ IMPLEMENTED

### Technology Choices

- **Frontend**: React 18 + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js 20 + Fastify + TypeScript + Prisma ✅ COMPLETED
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 16 with event sourcing ✅ IMPLETED
- **Testing**: Vitest (unit) + Supertest (integration) + Playwright (E2E) ✅ CONFIGURED
- **Containerization**: Docker + Docker Compose ✅ WORKING

### Development Workflow

- **Taskmaster AI**: TDD workflow management with sub-agents ✅ WORKING
- **Memory Bank**: Long-term knowledge base for project continuity ✅ MAINTAINED
- **Sub-Agents**: test-runner, schema-keeper, ui-developer, backend-developer, commit-bot

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Task 9) ✅ READY TO START

1. ✅ **Canvas Foundation**: Created main SVG canvas component with proper sizing
2. ✅ **Pan/Zoom Controls**: Implemented mouse and touch-based pan/zoom functionality
3. ✅ **Background Grid**: Added 8px grid pattern with proper scaling
4. ✅ **Keyboard Navigation**: Added arrow keys, zoom in/out, and reset view controls
5. ✅ **Event Integration**: Canvas ready for event sourcing backend API integration
6. ✅ **Document Editor Modal**: Complete TipTap editor with full functionality
7. ✅ **Node Components**: Complete DocumentNode and AgentNode with drag functionality
8. ✅ **Edge Connection System**: Complete SVG edge rendering with bezier curves
9. ✅ **Left Sidebar**: Complete sidebar with chains, documents, and agents lists

### Upcoming Tasks

- **Task 9**: Implement Right Inspector Panel for Agent Configuration (Next)
- **Task 10**: Build TipTap Document Editor Modal ✅ COMPLETED

## Active Patterns & Preferences

### Code Organization

- **Shared Schemas**: Zod schemas in `schemas/` directory ✅ WORKING
- **Component Structure**: React components in `src/components/`
- **API Routes**: Fastify routes in `api/routes/` ✅ COMPLETED
- **Database**: Prisma schema and migrations in `prisma/` ✅ COMPLETED

### Development Patterns

- **TDD First**: Write tests before implementation ✅ PROVEN EFFECTIVE
- **Schema Validation**: All data validated with Zod ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript throughout the stack ✅ WORKING
- **Event Sourcing**: All state changes as events ✅ IMPLEMENTED

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Vitest for individual components and functions
- **Integration Tests**: Supertest for API endpoints ✅ 38 TESTS PASSING
- **E2E Tests**: Playwright for user workflows
- **Test Coverage**: Achieved 100% integration test coverage for backend

## Current Challenges & Considerations

### Technical Challenges

- **Canvas Performance**: Need to optimize SVG rendering for 100+ nodes
- **Real-time Updates**: Canvas state synchronization with backend events
- **Agent Integration**: Pluggable LLM provider architecture
- **State Management**: Complex state synchronization between frontend and backend

### Development Challenges

- **Learning Curve**: Team needs to understand canvas interaction patterns
- **Testing Complexity**: E2E testing for canvas interactions
- **Performance Optimization**: Smooth pan/zoom with large numbers of nodes

## Important Learnings

### Project Insights

- **Event Sourcing Benefits**: Complete audit trail and undo/redo capabilities ✅ PROVEN
- **TDD Workflow**: Faster development with fewer bugs ✅ PROVEN
- **Schema-Driven**: Type safety and validation across the stack ✅ WORKING
- **Memory Bank**: Essential for maintaining project context ✅ MAINTAINED

### Technical Insights

- **React 18 Features**: Concurrent features for better performance
- **Fastify Performance**: High-performance web framework ✅ EXCELLENT
- **Prisma Type Safety**: Excellent TypeScript integration ✅ WORKING
- **Docker Development**: Consistent environment across team ✅ WORKING

## Active Decisions

### Current Implementation Decisions

- **Port Configuration**: Frontend (4000), Backend (4002), Database (5435), Adminer (8081) ✅ WORKING
- **Package Structure**: Monorepo with shared dependencies ✅ WORKING
- **Development Environment**: Docker Compose for local development ✅ WORKING
- **Testing Framework**: Vitest for fast unit testing ✅ WORKING

### Pending Decisions

- **Canvas Library**: React Flow vs. custom SVG implementation
- **State Management**: Zustand vs. React Context for canvas state
- **Real-time Communication**: SSE vs. WebSocket for agent streaming
- **Caching Strategy**: React Query vs. SWR for API data
