# Product Context: Chain Workspace Application

## Why This Project Exists

### Problem Statement

Current document processing workflows are typically:

- **Linear and rigid**: Fixed sequences that don't adapt to document variations
- **Manual and error-prone**: Require human intervention at each step
- **Difficult to visualize**: Complex workflows are hard to understand and modify
- **Lack of AI integration**: Limited use of modern AI capabilities for document processing
- **No version control**: Changes to processing chains are not tracked or reversible

### Solution Vision

The Chain Workspace Application provides a visual, interactive environment where users can:

- **Design workflows visually**: Drag-and-drop interface for creating document processing chains
- **Integrate AI agents seamlessly**: Connect LLM-powered agents for intelligent document processing
- **Iterate rapidly**: Real-time editing and testing of processing chains
- **Track changes**: Complete version history with undo/redo capabilities
- **Collaborate effectively**: Multi-user support for team-based workflow development

## How It Should Work

### User Experience Flow

1. **Workspace Entry**: User opens the application and sees an empty canvas with sidebar panels
2. **Chain Creation**: User drags document and agent nodes from the library onto the canvas
3. **Connection Building**: User connects nodes to define the processing flow
4. **Configuration**: User configures agents with prompts, models, and tools
5. **Document Editing**: User creates and edits documents using the rich text editor
6. **Execution**: User runs the chain to process documents with real-time feedback
7. **Iteration**: User refines the chain based on results and saves versions

### Key User Interactions

- **Canvas Navigation**: Pan with mouse drag, zoom with mouse wheel, grid snapping
- **Node Management**: Drag nodes to position, double-click to edit, right-click for context menu
- **Connection Creation**: Click and drag from node ports to create connections
- **Document Editing**: Double-click document nodes to open TipTap editor modal
- **Agent Configuration**: Select agent nodes to open configuration panel
- **Chain Execution**: Use play button to run entire chains or individual agents

### Core User Personas

1. **Document Processors**: Create automated workflows for document classification, extraction, and transformation
2. **AI Researchers**: Experiment with different agent configurations and chain architectures
3. **Business Analysts**: Design workflows for data extraction and analysis from documents
4. **Content Creators**: Build chains for content generation, editing, and publishing

## Business Context
